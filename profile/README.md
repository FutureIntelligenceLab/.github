# Future Intelligence Labs

**AI-Native Automation for Chip Design**

Future Intelligence Labs builds multi-agent AI systems that automate the silicon lifecycle — from spec to RTL, verification, and PPA optimization.

Chip design is a coordination problem.  
We turn it into a programmable workflow.

## What We Build

- Spec → RTL generation  
- Automated testbench & DV  
- Simulation orchestration  
- Bug iteration loops  
- PPA-guided exploration  
- Multi-agent workflow optimization  

Our agents execute, learn, and iterate — not just assist.

## Collaboration

We partner with semiconductor and system companies to accelerate tape-out cycles and reduce verification bottlenecks.
